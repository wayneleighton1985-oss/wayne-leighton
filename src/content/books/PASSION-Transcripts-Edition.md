title: PASSION Transcripts Edition
author: Wayne Leighton
description: >
  Why does the Transcripts Version cost £150?

  It has cost me thousands to get all the audio transcribed. Secondly, the book
  is very thick. The printing costs are expensive. Thirdly, this edition is
  juicy. It shows the lies, deceit and manipulation not just by government
  officials, but by the judiciary. It exposes the system for what it really is.
  There is no other book out there like it, not just in terms of information,
  but irrefutable proof as it is a word for word account of what was said in the
  various different cases. Everything from presentation, to cross-examination,
  to judgment. It also includes all the corrupted investigations and complaint
  coverup decisions.

What is the difference between the information in the standard book, and the seminar?

The book is about ‘what’ I did. This seminar explains ‘how’ I did it. Further, the seminar talks about my battles with other authorities, whereas the book only talks about my fight against the police. As the book is a memoir, I did not want to talk about corruption only. It tells my life story. The seminar will talk about strategies that you can use. It highlights the deceptive techniques that the authorities will use to railroad you, how to spot them, and how to bring claims against them in different jurisdictions. Some examples of the authorities I have beaten in court are:

\*  The Chief Constable on North Yorkshire Police (twice)

\*  The Information Commissioner (twice)

\*  First Tier Tribunal

\*  Independent Police Complaints Commission

\*  Bristow and Sutor

\*  Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority

\*  Crown Prosecution Service

\*  DVLA
